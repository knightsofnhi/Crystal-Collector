# Unit-4-Game

Let's collect some gems in this Crystal Collector game!

Here's how to play!

1. Click on the gems to match the random number generated for you at the beginning of the game.
2. If your total of gems go above the random number, then you lose!
3. But, if your total of gems matches the random number, you win!
4. You won't know the value of the gems until you click them!
5. The value of the gems will automatically be added into your total, so do the math to figure out the value of each gem!
6. Be careful of which you click and how many times!
7. The value of each gem changes at the start of each game!

Have fun!
